# Introduction



# Data {#data}

The data was retrieved from Harvard's CCES Dataverse database, using the `nflverse` [@citenflverse] package. 

This data was downloaded, cleaned, parsed, analyzed, and visualized using R [@citeR], a statistical programming language, with package support from `tidyverse` [@citetidyverse], a collection of libraries which included the following packages that were utilized:

-   `ggplot2` [@citeggplot]
-   `dplyr` [@citedplyr]
-   `readr` [@citereadr]
-   `tibble` [@citetibble]

For additional assistance with data storage, the `arrow` [@citearrow] was used and for report generation, the `knitr` [@citeknitr] package was used.

The models were created using `tidymodels` [@citetidymodels]
